## Current Requirements
- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 2022
- CMake >= 3.16
- [DirectX SDK 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
- Steam with a copy of [Call of Duty: Black Ops](https://store.steampowered.com/app/42700/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops/)


## How to build
1) Install the above requirements and Clone repo
2) create a `/build` folder
3) `CMAKE .. -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=WIN32`
4) Open the generated .sln file
5) Build Debug or Release (Visual Studio dropdown)
6) Copy BLOPS Game files to `build/(BUILD_TYPE)/*` (Don't try to cherry-pick them, small files like localization.txt are needed)
8) Copy `binkw32.dll`, `steam.dll`, `steam_api.dll`, `steamclient.dll`, `tier0_s.dll`, `vpx.dll`, `vstdlib_s.dll` into the folder as well (You can find these in-tree in the respective folders)
11) Run the game via Visual Studio play button or just the .exe


```
Keep in Mind: This is a ~20 year old game with some known exploits. We will try to fix these as we become aware of them.
However, there is a non-zero chance of some type of binary exploitation when playing online. Use a sandbox (Sandboxie?) for peace of mind.

## Known Issues
(Use the **[issues](https://github.com/SwagSoftware/KisakBlack/issues)** section)

## Troubleshooting
- ***Can't Connect to Dedicated Server*** :
  -  Check `net_ip` and `net_port`, the server will increment the port if the preferred one isn't available but the client won't sweep upwards.
 - ***DLL Error upon launch*** :
   - You didn't copy over the necessary runtime DLL's

## FAQ
- Can we use AI in this project?
  - Yes you can, but you're still responsible for whatever you commit. In general, you should have the AI be assisting you, and not carrying you. We have started using AI to help de-bug, and it's been extremely helpful.
